# Simple Text Summarization using Sentiment Analysis 
This is an simple extractive text summarizer approach. 

In extractive summarization, sentences are selected from input document to represent as summary sentences. Here, through sentiment analysis, sentences were categorized into five types which are positive, very positive, neutral, negative, very negative. Neutral, very positive and very negative sentences have been selected as summary sentences. 

The code for sentiment analysis is collected from another repository which is https://github.com/Ruthwik/Sentiment-Analysis.
